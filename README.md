Project in "CAD for Digital H/W (E-CAD)" course 2019-2020

This project was implemented by me (Nina Panteleaki) and my lab teammate Andreas Karatzas 
when attending "CAD for Digital H/W (E-CAD)" lesson in Computer Engineering and Informatics Department
at University of Patras.
The tools that we utilised include 
-> a XSA-3S1000 Board with 1-Mgate Spartan-3 FPGA
-> a keyboard
-> a VGA screen
The code is written in Verilog and we used ISE WebPACK Design Software in order to program the FPGA.

The project subject is located in "project_ecad_2020.pdf" and the report for the exercises of the whole semester
can be read at "E-CAD-1054336-1041574.pdf" in cad_project repository.
